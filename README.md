Sometimes, you don't need a neural network...

A pretty long time ago, konsolas tried to develop a killaura detecting plugin which was kinda successful. (?)

Me, being pretty hyped by the idea too, tried to develop a plugin which can detect some combat pattern and worked like 3 days on it a few month ago.
Currently it is able to create "combat protocols" which write down when the attacker attacked with which angle to the target, how fast he moved etc.

Later on, once a client's killaura profile has been logged, a temporary profile of an suspect can be created and compared using some statistics.
Sadly, all my advanced statistic knowledge I had at this point came from YouTube so I wasn't really able to create sophisitcated comparison methods,
but Neutron (at it's current state) is kinda able to differ between a few killauras and a legit player. :smiley:
